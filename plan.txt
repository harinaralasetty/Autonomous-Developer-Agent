Action Plan
1. Agent - give the agent a task and see what's it thinking, like BabyAGI it should be able to think in steps. Give a problem and it making steps would be expected solution to this. 
2. Tools -
    (a) ability to write/overwrite the result from above to a file
    (b) execute a file in python 
3. Manager Agent - to avoid pocket problem where an agent gets stuck in a problem or error, make a manager, worker type of architecture where the manager can pull out the worker from the task or ask human intervention
